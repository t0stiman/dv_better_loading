# Immersive Cargo Loading

Derail Valley mod that overhauls the process of (un)loading cargo to make it more realistic.

## Installation

1. Install Unity Mod Manager(UMM).
2. Download this mods zip from the [releases](https://github.com/t0stiman/dv_better_loading/releases) page and drag-drop it into UMM.

## Station and cargo support

| Station              | Cargo               | Loading/unloading   | 
|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| City West            | shipping containers | loading & unloading |
| Coal Mine East/South | coal                | loading             |
| Coal Plant           | coal                | unloading           |
| Food Factory         | shipping containers | loading & unloading |
| Goods Factory        | shipping containers | loading & unloading |
| Harbor               | shipping containers | loading & unloading |
| Iron Mine East/West  | iron ore            | loading             |
| Machine Factory      | shipping containers | loading & unloading |

The loading of shipping containers at City South is unchanged because there is no gantry crane there.  
Unloading of coal and iron ore at Steel Mill is on my to-do list.

## Mod settings

In the mod settings you can change how fast cargo is loaded. Open the settings menu with ctrl+F10 (in game).
